# HexChat Tokyo Night Theme
This is a theme for HexChat I use in combination with [Korpsvart's](https://github.com/Fausto-Korpsvart/Tokyo-Night-GTK-Theme) GTK Tokyo Night theme.
It's based off [Enkia's](https://github.com/enkia/tokyo-night-vscode-theme) VSCode Theme. 
Just replace you colors.conf in ```/.config/hexchat```and you should be set.
